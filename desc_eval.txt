SCP-1998 does not use any sort of ammunition, instead firing an energy pulse via unknown mechanisms. The power source of SCP-1998 has never been determined; it does not require access to any external source of power, though it does require approximately five minutes between uses, presumably for cooldown or recharging purposes. The energy pulses generated by SCP-1998 have no effect on inorganic, inanimate, or non-human materials, dissipating on contact with anything other than a human body or clothing directly in contact with a human body. Pulses will dissipate after traveling approximately twenty meters. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1678 is a full-scale mirror-image reconstruction of the British city of London, located exactly one kilometer underneath the original city of London. Currently, only the Hyde Park district of SCP-1678 has been explored, but all buildings, at least within the explored district, correlate exactly to their surface counterparts in terms of location, as well as the exterior size and shape, although rarely in terms of architecture, building material, and interior layout. The city has been constructed to resemble the city as it was in the Victorian era, with constructions designed to resemble traditional gas lighting prevalent on the streets and with all modern buildings in the original city of London being represented in a Victorian style of architecture, most notably the skyscrapers of the Business district. Illumination is infrequent and unreliable, and it is unknown how SCP-1678 has acquired a steady oxygen and gas supply. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1375-1 is a steel service door in the decommissioned ███████ tube station of the London Underground. Historical records indicate that no anomalous properties were present when the station was decommissioned in 1994. When opened, SCP-1375-1 contains a standing space-time aperture to SCP-1375-2. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1749-1 is an ornately-painted control pad consisting of an analog screen and a standard QWERTY keyboard. When a message is typed onto the screen of SCP-1749-1 and the "send" button is pressed, specimens of SCP-1749-2 are created in locations around the continental United States. <EOS>
<BOS> " SCP-1467 is a 47 year old male of African American descent. Unless constantly reaffirming its existence, SCP-1467 slowly fades out of reality. The effect manifests in a gradual decrease in the ability to perceive SCP-1467 by any known means until it eventually vanishes. This has been known to affect objects and personnel in SCP-1467's immediate vicinity. The Foundation have been unable to determine the extent of this ability to a satisfactory degree but current experimental data suggests it is localised to SCP-1467. The subject claims to be a construction worker. It further claims its anomalous properties arose in a gradual fashion after the death of its wife and children in a car accident. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1632 refers to an entity believed to be of extradimensional or extraterrestrial origin. Witness descriptions show SCP-1632 to be a 45-year old Asian male with varying facial features, usually wearing a three-piece suit with a red tie and a bowler hat. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1610-1 is a series of humanoid individuals. All subjects are anatomically identical to humans, but exhibit no signs of sentience or sapience. Each instance is marked with one of four possible symbols somewhere on its body', <sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, '; as such, instances have been divided up into subgroups by symbol, designated as SCP-1610-A through SCP-1610-D, respectively. All subjects within a certain subgroup are identical. See Table-1610-Beta for greater detail about each subgroup. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1943-1 is Sarah Gruenwald, a 27-year-old European-American female and Level 1 Assistant Laboratory Technician formerly employed in the non-anomalous chemistry laboratory of Area-██. Prior to containment, SCP-1943-1 did not have clearance or certification for handling anomalous materials and was not known to have been in contact with any anomalous phenomena or materials during the three years in which she was employed. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1993 is a human right leg, severed at an angle beginning above the knee and descending to the patella. Examination of the leg has shown the presence of a small tattoo on the exterior side of the ankle, depicting a compass with the needle pointing to the southeast. Instances of SCP-1993 have been observed to decay at the normal rate for a severed limb. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1202 was recovered beneath a frozen lake near Site-█ in ███████, Canada. Personnel reported trouble sleeping and auditory hallucinations that often referenced the location of SCP-1202. A team was sent to investigate the lake based on the collective reports. A small wooden canoe was discovered in fragments on the lakebed next to an irregular ice formation. The chamber behind the blockage was empty save for the frozen and emaciated remains of the body of one human male, later DNA tested and carbon-dated, thusly identified as belonging to tribes once native to the lower portion of South America eight hundred years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> " SCP-1211 is the dilapidated ruin of a castle, 10 kilometers outside the city of ██████, Ireland. Only the first floor and basement of the structure remain in functional condition, the upper three floors having eroded and collapsed at indeterminate points in the castle's past. Initially, it was thought that any person entering SCP-1211 would be subject to its effect, though testing has proven that only males age 35 and older are affected. The reason for this is thought to be related to the terms of eligibility for kingship in Ireland at the time of the castle's construction. <EOS>
<BOS> " SCP-1021 is a set of 7 EXIT signs designed in Art Moderne dating back to the 1940's. The anomalous effect of SCP-1021 will only manifest if it is placed directly over a door made of solid wood; type and design may vary, but the door must be solid with no trappings (ex. windows). Any person opening a door with SCP-1021 over it will find themselves exiting out of a corresponding exit of the ███████ Cinema in █████, MI. Each sign of SCP-1021 belongs to a specific door in the cinema, with the main entrance being the only door without a connection. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1293 is a species of humanoid creatures of unknown origin. Each specimen of SCP-1293 is unique in appearance, although all specimens generally resemble costumed human beings. Autopsies performed on deceased specimens have shown that SCP-1293 are completely unclothed, with skin, bone, and muscle tissue mimicking various types of fabric. SCP-1293 possess biological components resembling a human circulatory system, except the system carries and distributes multicolored balls of sugar instead of blood. SCP-1293 have no apparent nervous systems or digestive tracts, and do not require food, drink, or sleep. SCP-1293 possess no visible reproductive organs; however, 54% of SCP-1293 specimens are capable of reproduction. For the purpose of this document, such specimens will be considered female and referred to as SCP-1293-A, whereas male (non-reproducing) specimens will be referred to as SCP-1293-B. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1404 consists of two items: a 715\xa0mL seemingly ceramic black bowl, measuring 15cm in diameter and 7cm high, and a seemingly stainless steel spoon, 16cm in length. Neither bear any marks indicating location or date of manufacture. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1288 is a cylindrical object with density, angular momentum, and refractive index consistent with glass of the same dimensions. The interior of SCP-1288 depicts the equivalent location in what has been determined to be an alternate timeline, believed to have diverged from our own in approximately the late 14th to early 15th Centuries. The world that is depicted is frozen in a single moment which astronomical observations from multiple locations indicate is the Winter Solstice of 2012 at approximately 0600 GMT. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1099-1 is chemically water, but possesses a magnetic dipole approximately the strength of neodymium. This liquid is also an anti-emulsifier, unable to mix with oil or normal water and remains in a single area by way of self-attraction. Particulate tests have shown that the liquid "flows" independently aligned with the nearest geomagnetic pole and attracts ferrous objects. Samples of the liquid that are boiled, distilled, or ionized condense into normal water. Similar loss of effect is noted when SCP-1099-1 is salinated, becoming ordinary saltwater. Freezing SCP-1099-1 effectively creates an ice bar-magnet, and it retains its unique exposure effects when it returns to a liquid state. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1836 is a green, non-tabular, pinnacle iceberg peaking 90m above the surface, approximately 123m in length. It is estimated to weigh between 150,000 and 175,000 metric tons and extends approximately 450 meters below the surface. Submersible surveys of the SCP-1836 have revealed many large tunnels extending into the object. Aside from coloration the object appears to be an ordinary iceberg. Core samples have revealed that the iceberg is composed of ordinary ice. Algae entrapped within the ice give the object its unusual coloration.', ' On ██/██/██13 SCP-1836 broke containment. During a routine implementation of the Helping Hands Protocol, the on-site shaman, Teriaque LeChatelier, was interrupted by an unknown party during his procedure. The following is a summary of the video surveillance footage taken by the observation post. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1935 is a two-story concrete structure located in the outskirts of ███████, █████. The ground floor consists of four identical chambers and a staircase to the second floor. The second floor houses an additional four chambers. Each chamber contains an empty alcove, four meters in radius, indented into the floor. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1196 is the basement of the former ███████ █████████ Back Clinic, located in ███████, ███████. The basement walls and ceiling are all composed of concrete, with several support pillars at various points in the room. The floor is unfinished. Fluorescent lighting tubes line the ceiling, but only three (3) of them remain in working condition. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1267 is a mammalian organism, which as of 6/9/20██ resembles an adult female pronghorn antelope. Thus far, attempts at interbreeding or crossbreeding SCP-1267 with common stock have failed to produce viable offspring. All observed instances of SCP-1267 to date have been female. SCP-1267 is effectively indistinguishable from its "template" species. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1823 is an autonomous and self-sustaining migratory whirlpool. The dimensions of the whirlpool vary between approximately 1km and 4km in diameter, with current speeds of 100-170kmph. SCP-1823 is capable of "traveling" at a maximum observed speed of 30 knots, and often moves contrary to present oceanic currents or conditions. There is no observed pattern to SCP-1823\'s path, though it appears to avoid areas with depths of 500m or less. If, however, any naval vehicle occupied by one or more human approaches within 70-300km of the anomaly, it will actively target that vessel. SCP-1823 does not track airborne vehicles. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1663 is the special duty assignment for personnel assigned to Containment Site 1663-0, located near [REDACTED]. The research performed at Containment Site 1663-0 is considered a Euclid-class infohazard, thus necessitating the extraordinary containment requirements outlined in this document. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1928 is a banjo uke or “banjolele”, identical to a discontinued brand originally mass-manufactured in the 1920s. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1687 is a violin of uncertain provenance and age. At baseline, it appears to be in a state of great disrepair, with chipped F-holes, a partial crack through the neck, and fraying sheepgut strings. When played while in this state, the quality of music is extremely poor, in keeping with the apparent condition of the instrument. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1805 is a life-sized anatomically-correct female mannequin intended for use as a sex doll. It was marketed under the trademark ████████ and manufactured by [REDACTED] in 20██. It has a PVC skeleton with steel joints and flesh made of medical grade silicone. The object shows considerable wear, with its original pigmentation faded or missing over roughly 35% of its surface. When SCP-1805 is in an inactive phase, it is indistinguishable from other products of similar manufacture. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1666 is a LP album by ████ ████████ titled ████████ ██ ███ and released by ███ Records in the United States in 198█. Labeling of both SCP-1666 and its original packaging indicates no differences from any other albums produced in the same batch that includes SCP-1666, though no other copies of ████████ ██ ███ seem to share SCP-1666’s anomalous properties. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1945 is an anomalous region located over a rural household in █████████. In all observed states the anomalous zone covers the entirety of the structure; however, the size and shape of the field is influenced by multiple conditions, including but not limited to temperature, humidity, electromagnetic waves of various wavelengths, and the presence of ferrous metal. The diameter of the anomalous area varies from an average of 49 meters at midnight to an average of 104 meters at noon.', ' Following the events of Test Log SCP-1945-1.2 the previous day, SCP-1945-2 deviated widely from previously observed routine. SCP-1945-2 slept until 07:00\xa0A.M, and was not awoken during the deliveries of food. SCP-1945-2 was observed pacing the cell over the course of several hours, finally settling at the table at approximately 10:45\xa0A.M. Unusual activity ceased until 3:15 P.M, at which point SCP-1945-2 began to move furniture to barricade the door, including the table, both chairs, and bedding. SCP-1945-2 then propped herself against the door, and held the door shut for the following 62 minutes, before being forced back by a pair of armored guards.', ' At approximately 5:40 P.M, lighting in the cell containing SCP-1945-2 went out. Secondary lighting kicked in after 30 seconds, revealing that SCP-1945-2 had moved from the bed and was repeatedly striking the door with both fists. Observation of her behavior suggests she was able to hear, or by some other means perceive, something that caused her great distress. This behavior continued for another 43 seconds, at which point an unknown non-humanoid entity entered the cell via destruction of the far wall. Showing no physical harm, the entity proceeded to grasp and throw SCP-1945-2 across the length of the room, causing an immediate drop in the quality of SCP-1945-1, rendering approximately 87% of signal data unrecoverable.', ' At approximately 2:43 P.M, SCP-1945-1 ceased to transmit for a total of 60 minutes, during which time Junior Researcher ████ was assigned to monitor until the return of the signal. Upon the return of SCP-1945-1, the transmission consisted of uniform black frames with negligible interference.', ' At approximately 2:43\xa0A.M, SCP-1945-2 was removed from the visual range of SCP-1945-1 by two armored guards. SCP-1945-2 woke immediately, struggling and attempting to assault the guards when grasped. Despite considerable resistance, SCP-1945-2 was removed from the room without incident. Quality of SCP-1945-1 began to decline approximately 37 seconds later. Approximately two minutes following the removal of SCP-1945-2, another armored figure approached the source of SCP-1945-1, and proceeded to move it from its location. Despite this, SCP-1945-1 continued to transmit, slowly declining in quality. SCP-1945-1 has continued to transmit to the current date; however, the quality of the signal has not improved, rendering all frames transmitted since then unrecognizable. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1337 is a ', <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Level 2 Humanoid Apparition, location bound, non-violent, corporeal</span>, " Level 5 Humanoid Apparition, free roaming, corporeal, actively aggressive. It appears to be the wraith of one Mary Talish, who was abducted, ritually tortured, and executed on May 19th, 1952, in Muncie, Indiana. Starting 19 months after her death, SCP-1337 began to appear on the 19th of every month, walking down Mayflower Road (1337-Alpha), attempting to flag down any passing vehicle. It would tell anyone who picked it up that it had gotten lost, and was in need of a ride back to its home (1337-Delta). SCP-1337 would give directions in such a way as to ensure passing the graveyard where Mary Talish was buried (1337-Beta), and then encourage the driver to stop at the cemetery. Once out of the vehicle, SCP-1337 would vanish, leaving the driver to find her sweater (1337-Gamma). Anyone touching 1337-Gamma would then feel an urge to return the item to Site 1337-Delta, and Mary Talish's parents. Despite many attempts to secure 1337-Gamma, it would invariably vanish from containment at or around sunset on the 19th. <EOS>
<BOS> ' SCP-1344 refers to a collection of five goggles of various types, all exhibiting anomalous behaviour when worn by a human being. Site-44 currently holds the following instances of SCP-1344: <EOS>
